## Small Wins, Huge Progression
Commit with huge addition and deletion if you want to be rejected.
Let's win as small as a crackle, as small as a grain salt or sugar.
Because, it is more progressive if you commit little things.
Plus, it would be way more easier for the community to see how things have changed in the past.

## Use Conventional Commit Messages
DO
```
git commit -m "feat(src/index): Added my name as a headline"
```
DON'T
```
git commit -m "Adds my name on a headline"
```
Well, if you can explain to each of 10,000 people about which headline you just changed DON'Ts becomes DOs.

## Learn As You Fail
Don't be bothered with your failures,
this is a community so you will get help.

## SCSS Style
```scss
div.class#id {
	/* Display; properties that directly changes the element's look */

	/* Sizing; margin, padding, etc. */

	/* Positioning; properties that changes the element's position or rotation */

	/* Misc; box-sizing, box-shadow, filter */

	/* Nested SCSS; Effects; psuedo selector; :hover, :active, :target, etc. */

	/* Nested SCSS; Child elements and/or parent elements */
}
```
